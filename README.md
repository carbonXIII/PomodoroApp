# Pomodoro App

## Vision

This app is for students and professionals to have a tool that will improve their time management skills.  This product will fit into the growing market need for productivity apps, that leads to better productivity and time management assisting with habits and self-control due to the pomodoro technique being a well established productivity method.  Unlike the other Pomodoro apps on the market, our app will offer a comprehensive stats tracking system that will be built into the app, and works well with the agile development process.

### Team Contribution
- [Ishaan Bhattacharya / ishaanb555](https://github.com/ishaanb555) - - Completed user stories 12 and 24 and their corresponding requirements (made a login screen with a hide password functionality) and then wrote some manual tests for them as they are mostly just xml code and used for UI purposes. 
- [Jordan Richards / thefinalstarman](https://github.com/thefinalstarman) - - Finished up the rest of the code for user story 1, including wiring the task detail and timer screens. Wrote tests for most of the requirements.
- [Kevin Perez / KaeWing](https://github.com/KaeWing) - - Completed most of story 11 which requires some sort of notification system to be implemented once the timer is done. Will have to revise again once app is further in development.
- [Kimberly Szekely / Kimberly Szekely](https://github.com/KimberlySzekely) - - Designed UI mockup to match design document specifications
- [Timothy Phillips / Timothy-Phillips](https://github.com/Timothy-Phillips) - - Explored methods for integration with Google Calendar and Trello. Produced and edited the demonstration video.
